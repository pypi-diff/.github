Daily generated diffs for pypi package releases

processes the pypi changelog and if a new release for a package is published, attempts to create diffs between old and new version using diffoscope.
Projects with artifacts > 10 MB are ignored and some "special cases" are not handled yet: no guarantee that all packages are tracked.
Changes are pushed to daily created repositories.
